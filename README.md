010Editor-stuff
===============

A collection of 010Editor specific stuff. Scripts and templates
that I've made or edited to suite my own purposes, mainly for
Android based reversing/analysis, most will require [010Editor](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor)
to work. These have only been tested on the native OSX version of
010Editor.

If you come into any DEX files, or APK/JAR/ZIP files which these
scripts/templates cannot properly parse, please feel free to email
me directory, or submit an issue to this repo. I will gladly take
a look at the issue and attempt to fix it! If you could attach the
offending file, that would be even better.
